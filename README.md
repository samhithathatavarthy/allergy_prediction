# Predicting Allergies Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to our project on predicting allergies using machine learning! In this GitHub README, we provide an overview of our research, data requirements, and objectives.

## Research Question

**Can Genetic Data and Historical Allergy Patterns Predict Susceptibility to Seasonal and Food Allergies?**

Allergies can significantly impact an individual's quality of life, and understanding one's susceptibility to allergies is crucial for personalized healthcare.

## Data Requirements

To address this research question effectively, we require two main types of data:

### User Data

- Age
- Gender
- Location (city or region)
- Family history
- Previous allergies (seasonal, food, etc.)
- Allergies in childhood
- Dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan)
- Smoking status (if applicable)
- Alcohol consumption (if applicable)
- Exercise habits
- Known exposure to common allergens (e.g., pets, pollen, dust mites)
- Any allergy symptoms experienced in the past (e.g., sneezing, itching, hives)
- Current medications or treatments for allergies (if applicable)
- Known food allergies
- Option to connect with genetic testing services (e.g., 23andMe) for more personalized results.

### General Data Set

In addition to user-specific data, we'll leverage a comprehensive general data set containing attributes such as ID or Participant Code, age, gender, location, family history, allergy types, symptoms, treatment, genetic data, and environmental factors. This rich dataset will allow us to explore broader trends and patterns in allergy susceptibility.

## Data Preprocessing

To ensure the quality and reliability of our dataset, we will begin by cleaning and preprocessing the data. This critical step involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features, setting the foundation for robust analysis and modeling.

## Project Overview

Our project is a continuation of previous research, particularly the study titled "Transgenerational Development of Food Allergies and Allergic Rhinitis." In this earlier work, we delved into the transgenerational aspects of allergy development. Now, we are taking this knowledge a step further by incorporating modern machine learning techniques to create an application that helps users understand their allergy susceptibility based on their unique genetic makeup and historical allergy patterns.

Stay tuned for updates as we make progress with our research and application development!
