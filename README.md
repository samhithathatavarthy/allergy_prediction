## Introduction

Welcome to our project on predicting allergies using machine learning! In this GitHub README, we provide an overview of our research, data requirements, and objectives.

## Research Question

**Can Genetic Data and Historical Allergy Patterns Predict Susceptibility to Seasonal and Food Allergies?**

Allergies can significantly impact an individual's quality of life, and understanding one's susceptibility to allergies is crucial for personalized healthcare.

## Data Requirements

To address this research question effectively, we require two main types of data:

### User Data

- Age
- Gender
- Location (city or region)
- Family history
- Previous allergies (seasonal, food, etc.)
- Allergies in childhood
- Dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan)
- Smoking status (if applicable)
- Alcohol consumption (if applicable)
- Exercise habits
- Known exposure to common allergens (e.g., pets, pollen, dust mites)
- Any allergy symptoms experienced in the past (e.g., sneezing, itching, hives)
- Current medications or treatments for allergies (if applicable)
- Known food allergies
- Option to connect with genetic testing services (e.g., 23andMe) for more personalized results.

### General Data Set

In addition to user-specific data, we'll leverage a comprehensive general data set containing attributes such as ID or Participant Code, age, gender, location, family history, allergy types, symptoms, treatment, genetic data, and environmental factors. This rich dataset will allow us to explore broader trends and patterns in allergy susceptibility.

## Data Preprocessing

To ensure the quality and reliability of our dataset, we will begin by cleaning and preprocessing the data. This critical step involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features, setting the foundation for robust analysis and modeling.

## Project Overview

Our project is a continuation of previous research, particularly the study titled "Transgenerational Development of Food Allergies and Allergic Rhinitis." In this earlier work, we delved into the transgenerational aspects of allergy development. Now, we are taking this knowledge a step further by incorporating modern machine learning techniques to create an application that helps users understand their allergy susceptibility based on their unique genetic makeup and historical allergy patterns.

## Abstract from Previous Paper

Both environmental and genetic factors play a role in allergies. Allergies are influenced by genes and how they control immune cell function. Several studies have examined the occurrence of allergic disease in children and its association with other risk factors, including allergic disease in parents. Specific toxins like CO2 and other health conditions can be related to the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. The response to food allergies was observed in many studies to conclude that heritability from parents to offspring is one of the leading risk factors for allergic diseases. Several studies have found a significant increase in the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in males than in females. Avoidance of a particular food was associated with an increased risk of developing an allergy to that food. At the molecular level, T cells are found to affect allergy outcomes through their part of the immune response. Food proteins such as milk, egg, and peanut - common food allergens - may cause an immune response in allergic individuals. Different therapies include Epicutaneous Immunotherapy (EPIT) and specific infant milk protein formulas. If this formula is taken from infancy, the allergic responses can be prevented/reduced. As with seasonal allergies, prevention can be mediated by avoiding different pollution environments that may cause additional irritation, temperature control in a given atmosphere/humidity, and therapies of Vitamin C for immunity. With many other seasonal allergy triggers, it is ubiquitous among populations and dependent on the area and season.

## Conclusion from Previous Paper

Overall, AR was more common in males than females. Parents with AR are also more likely to pass it to their offspring, as family history is a vital link. This showed an essential link between parental rhinitis AR and children. Exposure to many toxins can result in the development of AR or further progression of the intensity of this allergic disease. While looking at the genetic basis of food proteins and their effect on the body, it was found that a common theme of T cells and CD4+ T cells has changed. An early introduction of peanuts also significantly decreased the possible development of peanut allergy in children and mediated individuals' immune systems to the allergic protein. Polymorphism has a role in the genetic sequence that influences the Ige levels and T helper cells when trying to create an antibody. More study on the genetic basis of cells and their reaction to allergies can lead to further explanation around the field and better understanding. With environmental impact and therapeutic solution, it was found that pollution does have a substantial cause in getting AR. Chemicals like sulfur dioxide and indoor chemicals cause increased chances of AR. The presence of sulfur dioxide in the vicinity of an air-polluting factory increases the risk of AR. Therapeutic ways involve EPIT treatments, early introduction to allergic foods, ingestion of cow milk formula, intravenous vitamin C, protein hydrolysate formula, and food protein exposure. Most significant is the therapeutic way of milk formulas for henâ€™s milk allergy prevention for younger individuals. An increase in direction since childhood in moderate levels tends to help any food protein allergy. With preventions considered, it can make individuals reasonable about their allergies to foods before further adulthood to avoid severe allergies and lack of protein foods. There are many unanswered questions about allergies, such as why the body mistakes a threat, even though it is a very complex system. However, specific interventions, such as many available therapies by age group, to reduce the risk of getting an allergy by early exposure and observing patterns in cells and genes can further expand knowledge on this subject.
